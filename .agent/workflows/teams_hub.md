# Teams Hub Workflow

This workflow describes the process for managing multiple softball teams and their associated tournament data.

## 1. Access the Teams Hub
The **Teams Hub** is the high-level landing page of the application.
- If no team is selected, the app defaults to the Hub.
- To return to the Hub from any dashboard, click the **Logo** in the top-left or use the **🔄 Switch Team** button in the header.

## 2. Organization Management (Teams)
- **Create a Team**: Click "+ New Team" or "+ Register Your Team" to define a new organization.
- **Edit a Team**: Use the "⚙️ Edit Team" button on the Team Overview header to update names or descriptions.
- **Delete a Team**: Use the "🗑 Delete Team" button. *Warning: This removes all tournaments, players, and games associated with that team.*

## 3. Selecting and Navigating Teams
- Click any **Team Card** in the Hub to "Enter" that team's specific environment.
- The dashboard will default to the **Roster (Players)** tab, allowing you to manage the team's athletes.

## 4. Hierarchical Data Entry
Use the **Sidebar** to navigate the team's hierarchy:

### Organization Section
- **Overview**: High-level team stats.
- **Roster**: Manage Players (Squad).

### Events Section
- **Events List**: Create or select a tournament.
- **Current Event**: Once an event is selected, use the sidebar to access **Games** and **Tournament Stats**.

To navigate back, use the generic "Hierarchy Stepper" at the top of the page.

## 5. Global Search & Performance
- Use the Hub to see a "Birds Eye View" of all organizations.
- Summary badges on Team Cards provide high-level counts of total tournaments and games logged.
