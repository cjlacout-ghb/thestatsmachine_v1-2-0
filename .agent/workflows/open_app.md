1. Check if the application is already running. If it is, identify the correct URL.
2. If the server is not running, execute `npm.cmd run dev` from the project root.
3. Wait for the terminal to show the "Ready in..." or "Local: http://localhost:..." message.
4. Launch the browser subagent to navigate to the application URL.
5. Instruct the subagent to: "Navigate to the URL, verify that 'THE STATS MACHINE' is visible, capture EXACTLY ONE screenshot for confirmation, and then TERMINATE immediately."
